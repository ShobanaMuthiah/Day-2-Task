DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINDOW AND DOCUMENT OBJECT

WINDOW OBJECT
    * Window Object is JavaScript global object in javascript browser.
    * Window object represents the browser window.
    * It contains the document object.
    * Window object represents the open window in browser.
    * The JavaScript window object sits at the top of the JavaScript Object hierarchy
    * The JavaScript window object provides methods to display three types of message dialogs, the alert, confirmation and prompt dialogs.
    * It is the parent node in browser so we can directly call it by window.
    * Example:- In the console, we can simply run the object as 'window'.
                    >>window
    * window interface is home to a variety of functions, namespaces, objects, and constructors which are not necessarily directly associated with the concept of a user interface window.
    * The following is denotes the properties and methods of window object,
    
    WINDOW OBJECT'S INSTANT PROPERTIES                WINDOW OBJECT'S INSTANT METHODS
    -> window.caches                                  -> window.alert()
    -> window.navigator                               -> window.blur()
    -> window.close                                   -> window.ClearTimeOut()
    -> window.console                                 -> window.dump()
    -> window.document                                -> window.focus()

DOCUMENT OBJECT
    * Document object is the object property of Window object.
    * The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents.
    * Dynamic HTML was the immediate ancestor of the Document Object Model.
    * Document object represents the HTML parser and CSS parser into the document.
    * You can access the complete information and elements of the DOM from this document object.
    * It also allows you to create cookies for the webpage.
    * The document object also provides events related to the loading of the document and its resources.
    * It is the property of window object so we can use document object simply called by window or else it can run using 'document'.
    * Example:-
        In console, we simply run the command either of below one
            >> document (or)
            >> window.document
    * It is the top node for all those HTML DOM structure. 

                  document           
                     |
                    HTML
                  /      \
             head         body
            /    \        /    \
         meta   link    <h1>    <p>
         
    * The simple way to access elements in the document object is by using the below method.
                document.getElementById() 
    
    * Future Levels of the DOM specification will provide:
            => A structure model for the internal subset and the external subset.
            => Validation against a schema.
            => Control for rendering documents via stylesheets.
            => Access control.
            => Thread-safety.
